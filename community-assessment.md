## Introduce yourself

I am Bhavesh Parvatkar from the School of Engineering, RK University. I am pursuing my B. Tech. in Computer Engineering. Along with academics, I also prefer reading technological blogs and videos to keep myself updated with the latest information in the field of computer science. 

I like to play FPS games such as Apex Legends and Call of Duty. I also like to cook food and travel to explore the beauty of nature. Linkin Park is my favorite band. 

For the last 3 years, I have been part of various communities and have completed numerous activities in the college and also outside the campus. Communities such as E-Cell, Student-Cell, Public Welfare have given be a strong understanding of the working and functionalities of a healthy community. Our college even has a dedicated cell called ISTE Student Chapter which is responsible for student development in the field of technology and soft skills.

I have seen that students are highly energetic and enthusiastic to get involved in various projects and Hackathons. However, when they experience their 1st Hackathon, they face huge troubles that demotivate many and make them quit. To keep students future-ready not only Hackathons but also for jobs and other opportunities, they should be involved in activities that can help them to cultivate skills required to be successful in events like Hackathons and corporate world. A community dedicated specifically to focus on community collaborations and the development of skills will increase their team-work efficiency and help to build communication skills.

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- **Hands-on Experience**
Students are very eager to build a real-world solution to test their skills and learnings. They need a platform that can keep them engaged in activities that are responsible for building efficient solutions. 

- **Learn latest technology**
One of the common problems that students face while participating in events such as Hackathons are about new technologies such as AI and Machine Learning, having an app with appealing UI and UX, etc. Students have the solution but fail to imply them as they lack understanding. A community that can help them to gain knowledge and understanding in such domains will motivate them to carry their self-driven projects and gain experience.

- **Communication with developers**
A community dedicated to the development of various skills will help to bring students together and work collaboratively on problems. It can help them to find like-minded developers and cultivate team-work and leadership skills.

- **Industrial Experience**
The community also needs to communicate with those who have strong industrial experiences to understand the do's and don'ts while learning to follow the best industrial practices. We know that every industry has its work framework and having experience with such a framework can help them to secure better job opportunities.

- **Higher studies**
Not every student wants to go for a job. Many prefer pursuing masters and Ph.D. ISTE takes care that students can get admission in their dream college by providing a platform to connect with foreign colleges. RK University already has tie-ups with Universities in Poland and seminars are conducted for students from every branch to guide them about the admission process and how they can improve their skills and successfully get admission in their desired colleges.

Many students want to participate in events organized by other Universities. It can be online or at their scheduled venue. Students can get all the details about the latest events happening within India and some even around the world. Example:
